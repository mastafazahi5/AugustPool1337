## Overview

- Each week you have a couple of assignments to do.

- Day00 & Day01 are all shell commands.

- The rest of the days is all about C.

- Rushes are team projects but you don't choose your team.

- You will build most of C build-in functions from scratch.

- Days require 50% to be validated, but exams require 25%.

- Never copy paste otherwise -42 will be your price.



**Note**: *This is everything I've done at the school, but it's not fully complete.*



## Advices you may need

- Learn about norminette and moulinette tricks & rules more than C.

- Try to make a progress and not to be the 1st to validate the days.

- Never ever sacrifice your sleep, otherwise you're fucked.

- RTFM! and don't ask, unless you're really really stuck.

- Finally I confirm that it will be one of your best experiences in life.
